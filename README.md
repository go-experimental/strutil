utility package for common string operations ( helping me to compare Go to Rust ) https://github.com/rust-playground/strutil

## Why
In my a efforts to learn Rust I decided to create a `strutil` package containing common string functions and compare them to Go; this is not a Go vs Rust comparison, I merely decided to take a language I know well and compare it to it's Rust counterpart code. https://github.com/rust-playground/strutil There are only a couple of functions currently but am looking to add more as I go.

## Open Invitation/Challenge
I am attempting to create the most efficient and idiomatic Go & Rust code possible and would like to **invite/challenge** the community to contribute in making the best code possible!

Hopefully everyone can learn something new :)

If you can make any of the functions more efficient, with better throughput or less allocations, ... make a pull request, I'll test and if it beats the current implementation I'll merge and now your the one to beat!
